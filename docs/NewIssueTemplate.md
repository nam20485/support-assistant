## Critical Success Factors

1. **Model Files**: Must obtain and package Phi-3-mini ONNX models
2. **Vector Embeddings**: Essential for effective RAG implementation
3. **Security First**: All agentic capabilities must be secure by design
4. **User Experience**: Maintain responsive UI throughout development
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing on diverse hardware configurations

## Risk Mitigation

- **Model Performance**: Test on low-end hardware early, provide fallbacks
- **Security Concerns**: Implement approval system before any system modification tools
- **Hardware Compatibility**: Use DirectML for broad GPU support, always provide CPU fallback
- **User Adoption**: Focus on clear documentation and intuitive UI design

## Dependencies

- ✅ Microsoft Phi-3-mini ONNX model files (need to download/package)
- ✅ Sample technical documentation for knowledge base (existing)
- ✅ Windows development environment with appropriate SDKs (existing)
- ✅ Avalonia UI framework and ONNX Runtime (existing)

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Application loads and runs on Windows 10/11
- [ ] AI provides accurate, contextual responses using local model
- [ ] RAG system successfully retrieves and uses knowledge base content
- [ ] Agentic tools can safely modify system settings with user approval
- [ ] Application handles errors gracefully across different hardware configurations
- [ ] User can complete common technical support tasks through natural language interface
